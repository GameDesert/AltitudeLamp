# AltitudeLamp
## About

The AltitudeLamp is a resin project I built with an integrated WS2812 lightstrip (commonly known as NeoPixels) and a Raspberry Pi Pico W to control the lights. The Pico W spawns a WiFi hotspot with a web interface at the local address `192.168.4.1`.

## How To Use

Flash MicroPython firmware to the Pico W, and then upload all the files in this repo.
Here is a description of each file:
